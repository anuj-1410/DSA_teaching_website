CodeMatrix is an interactive platform designed to help users learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). With visualizations, quizzes, and comprehensive guides, CodeMatrix empowers individuals to excel in programming and computer science.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Understand complex data structures like Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Stacks, Quick sort and Hashing through animations.
- **Quizzes**: Test your knowledge with quizzes for better practice.
- **Guided Learning**: Learn from experienced guides with step-by-step explanations.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Contact Us**: Reach out for support or inquiries directly from the platform.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
